# Recipe Box Web App
- Create recipe cards for your favorite recipes from all over the web, including images and links to the recipe page.

- Add your own personal notes/reminders to the recipe card, so that you can remember what worked (and what didn't!) next time you make that recipe.

- Drag recipe cards into a weekly meal planner, allowing you to plan out your menu for an entire week.

#Development
- The back end is built with Rails and serves JSON-formatted data to the front end, which is built with JS and uses HTML and CSS.
