Questions
2. How to clear values from input boxes once recipe is submitted

3. Why can't I call resp.json() in delete fetch request?

3. How to center the entire grid of cards

4. Why can't you attach event listeners iteratively? (i.e., need to wait until ALL delete buttons are created before adding event listeners to ALL of them, rather than attaching the listener to each one right after it is created)

5. How can I turn this into a multi page application? Say, with a nav bar for "recipe box", "weekly menu", etc.? Do you need more than one .html file?
